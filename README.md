### 4. Professional Self-Assessment
As I approach completing my degree in computer science, I am looking forward to beginning my career in the tech industry and using the skills that I have gained in my studies to add value to whatever organization I choose to work for. Throughout my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University I have gained experience in how to collaborate in a team environment, communicate to stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. 
  
In my CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project course, I gained skills in how to collaborate in a team environment by building a calculator app using Bitbucket. Each student built a component of the app, for example an add operation, and used Bitbucket to commit changes to the main branch of the app. In my DAT-220 Fundamentals of Data Mining course, I gained skills in how to communicate to stakeholders by analyzing customer data to determine how the business can be improved. I used JMP statistical software to create data models that helped to show patterns in the data. Then I used those models to develop strategies on how the business can be improved and submitted my recommendations to the client. In my CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course, I gained skills in how and when to use various data structures and algorithms though a series of labs. The labs demonstrated that there is more than one way to solve a problem or code a program. I learned that it is important to determine what the purpose and needs of a program are before writing one line of code. That determination will help inform the best algorithm to use and the appropriate data structures to use. From there, I learned to compare and analyze different algorithms and data structures combinations to determine why one approach might be better than the other. The difference could be an improvement in processing speed for example, which make a big difference depending on the nature of the application is and how many people are using it at the same time. In my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I gained skills in software engineering by playing the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, and Tester on a software development team comprised of my classmates. I learned what the responsibilities are for each role. I also learned the different forms of software development structures like the waterfall approach and agile development methodologies and the pros and cons of each. In my DAD-220 Introduction to SQL course, I gained skills in how to be build a database by using the SQL programming language and a database schema to build a contact list of people. In my CS-340 Client/Server Development course, I gained skills on how to implement security in a web application by adding a user login authentication component to a MongoDB database.
  
The artifact that I chose to demonstrate my computer science abilities in all three categories is the Animal Shelter Collection web application from CS-340 Client/Server Development. I have made enhancements to this web application in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. These are all components that form the “stack” in software applications. They are also all areas that are integral to developing any piece of software and necessary to become a back-end, front-end, or full-stack developer.
