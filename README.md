### 4. Professional Self-Assessment
As I approach completing my degree in computer science, I am looking forward to beginning my career in the tech industry and using the skills that I have gained in my studies to add value to whatever organization I choose to work for. Throughout my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University I have gained experience in how to collaborate in a team environment, communicate to stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security.

In my CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project course, I gained skills in how to collaborate in a team environment by building a calculator app using Bitbucket. Each student built a component of the app, for example an add operation, and used Bitbucket to commit changes to the main branch of the app. In my DAT-220 Fundamentals of Data Mining course, I gained skills in how to communicate to stakeholders by analyzing customer data to determine how the business can be improved. I used JMP statistical software to create data models that helped to show patterns in the data. Then I used those models to develop strategies on how the business can be improved and submitted my recommendations to the client. In my CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course, I gained skills in how and when to use various data structures and algorithms though a series of labs. The labs demonstrated that there is more than one way to solve a problem or code a program. I learned that it is important to determine what the purpose and needs of a program are before writing one line of code. That determination will help inform the best algorithm to use and the appropriate data structures to use. From there, I learned to compare and analyze different algorithms and data structures combinations to determine why one approach might be better than the other. The difference could be an improvement in processing speed for example, which make a big difference depending on the nature of the application is and how many people are using it at the same time. In my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I gained skills in software engineering by playing the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, and Tester on a software development team comprised of my classmates. I learned what the responsibilities are for each role. I also learned the different forms of software development structures like the waterfall approach and agile development methodologies and the pros and cons of each. In my DAD-220 Introduction to SQL course, I gained skills in how to be build a database by using the SQL programming language and a database schema to build a contact list of people. In my CS-340 Client/Server Development course, I gained skills on how to implement security in a web application by adding a user login authentication component to a MongoDB database.
  
The artifact that I chose to demonstrate my computer science abilities in all three categories is the Animal Shelter Collection web application from CS-340 Client/Server Development. I have made enhancements to this web application in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. These are all components that form the “stack” in software applications. They are also all areas that are integral to developing any piece of software and necessary to become a back-end, front-end, or full-stack developer. 

### 5. Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering
The artifact that I picked for the software engineering/design category is the Animal Shelter Collection web application from CS-340 Client/Server Development. The purpose of that project, which was created about four months ago, was to demonstrate skills in creating a Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) web application for interacting with the data in the database. In this case, the database contained records of all the animals in a shelter. The reason I selected this artifact is because in applying my enhancements, it demonstrates my abilities in software design and engineering. Please see the two tables below for an explanation of specifically how the artifact has been enhanced and how it showcases my skills in software development. The first table is a list of features from the artifact that I selected to be enhanced. The second table is how I enhanced those features.


|   Artifact     |
| ------------- |
|1) Old web app stack used (MongoDB, Python, PyMongo, JavaScript, HTML, Jupyter Dash) was complex and cumbersome to set up. It also involved converting the data from    the spreadsheet (csv file) to a JSON file so that MongoDB could read it.|
|2) Old web app does not auto format to a computer, phone, or tablet screen.|
|3) Old web app does not have a search bar.|
|4) On old web app, the user can look through the database table only ten records at a time.|
|5) On old web app, the user cannot filter their search by column.|
|6) On old web app, the user can only add, edit, or delete a record through the terminal or command line interface (CLI).|
|7) On old web app, the user cannot click on a record to view all the data in that record only.|
|8) The old web app does not have a way of refreshing the data in the table to make sure it is up-to-date other than the web browser’s refresh button.|
|9) The old app required a new username and password before each user could get access to making any changes to the app.|

| Artifact Enhancement & Outcomes Reached |

Through these enhancements I have met the course objectives that I planned in Module One in the following ways: it shows my ability to convert one code stack to another, enhance the user experience, expand the web app’s complexity, and improve a piece of software, and implement a new security component. Reflecting on the process of enhancing/modifying the artifact, I have learned how to search out the tools and frameworks that will allow me to achieve my enhancement plans most effectively and efficiently. The challenges that I faced was in selecting the right tools and frameworks that would make up a viable web app stack for my enhanced artifact.

### 6. Enhancement Two: Algorithms & Data Structures
The artifact that I picked for the algorithm and data structures category is the Animal Shelter Collection web application from CS-340 Client/Server Development. The purpose of that project, which was created about four months ago, was to demonstrate skills in creating a Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) web application for interacting with the data in the database. In this case, the database contained records of all the animals in a shelter. The reason I selected this artifact is because in applying my enhancements, it demonstrates my abilities in algorithms and data structures. Please see the two tables below for an explanation of specifically how the artifact has been enhanced and how it showcases my skills in algorithms and data structures. The first table is a list of features from the artifact that I selected to be enhanced. The second table is how I enhanced those features.

|   Artifact     |
| -------------  |
|1) Old web app shows the location of one animal at a time as one drop pin on a map.|

|   Artifact Enhancement & Outcomes Reached     |
| -------------  |
|1)	For new web app, I integrated a map component that allows users to click on a drop pin icon to see the location of an animal on a Google map and to also expand the map to a drop pin location of all animals in the database at the same time. I created another column in the spreadsheet called “map” to combine data from the “location_lat” and “location_long” columns and convert the “decimal” data type to the “LatLong” data type so that the latitude and longitude data can be displayed as a drop pin on a Google map. Users can also jump to any record by clicking on any other drop pin on the map. *This enhancement shows that I have designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices*|

Through these enhancements I have met the course objectives that I planned in Module One in the following ways: it shows my ability to convert one data structure to a different data structure to enhance the user experience, expand the web app’s complexity, and improve a piece of software. Reflecting on the process of enhancing/modifying the artifact, I have learned how to search out the tools and frameworks that will allow me to achieve my enhancement plans most effectively and efficiently. I have also learned how to modify data structures to create new functionality in my app. The challenges that I faced was in selecting the right tools and frameworks that would make up a viable web app stack for my enhanced artifact. Also, figuring out how to combine two datasets, in this case the “location_lat” and “location_long” datasets, into one dataset - the “map” dataset.

### 7. Enhancement Three: Databases
The artifact that I picked for the databases category is the Animal Shelter Collection web application from CS-340 Client/Server Development. The purpose of that project, which was created about four months ago, was to demonstrate skills in creating a Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) web application for interacting with the data in the database. In this case, the database contained records of all the animals in a shelter. The reason I selected this artifact is it demonstrates how I can improve the database portion of the application. Please see the two tables below for an explanation of specifically how the artifact has been enhanced and how it showcases my skills in databases. The first table is a list of features from the artifact that I selected to be enhanced. The second table is how I enhanced those features.

|   Artifact     |
| -------------  |
|1) Old web app used MongoDB for the database. MongoDB was cumbersome to set up, configure, and to interact with the other components of the web stack. It also involved converting the data from the spreadsheet (csv file) to a JSON file so that MongoDB could read it.|
|2) The old web app only allowed users to look through the database table ten records at a time.|
|3) Old web app shows the location of one animal at a time as one drop pin on a map. Old database did not have a combined longitude and latitude variable.|

|   Artifact Enhancement & Outcomes Reached     |
| -------------  |
|1)	New web app stack is simpler to set up (Google Sheets, Google AppSheet). No conversion of the spreadsheet data is needed. Yet, data can be added, read, edited, and deleted. This demonstrates my ability to use a different database to improve the app development process.|
|2)	In the new web app, users can scroll through records of the entire database. This demonstrates my ability to use a different web stack to improve the user experience.|
|3)	I integrated a map component into the new web app that allows users to click on a drop pin icon to see the location of an animal on a Google map and to also expand the map to a drop pin location of all animals in the database at the same time. To do this, I created another column in the spreadsheet called “map” to combine data from the “location_lat” and “location_long” columns and convert the “decimal” data type to the “LatLong” data type so that the latitude and longitude data can be displayed as a drop pin on a Google map. Users can also jump to any record by clicking on any other drop pin on the map. This demonstrates my ability to modify a database to provide data needed for a new feature in the app.|
